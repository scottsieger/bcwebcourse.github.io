                    Real GDP and price levels are two economic indicators that hold a lot of weight
                    when measuring a nation's output and overall well-being. In this project we look
                    at how these indicators are measured, and how economic models show relationships
                    and changes in the short run as well as the long run. We begin by looking at the Marginal 
                    Propensity to Consume and the Marginal Propensity to Spend. We then analyze the 
                    Consumption Function as well as the Aggregate Demand - Aggregate Supply curves in
                    short run equillibrium to see how households and firms affect aggregate output
                    and the price level. Economic policies and stabalizers are then discussed in an 
                    attempt to determine which course of action governments should take when facing a 
                    recession or slowing output. <em>Keynesian thought is employed throughout the project.</em>
