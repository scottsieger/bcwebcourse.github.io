                    The Statistics of Congressional Campaigning: Who Spends the Most and Why?
                    Our group poses the following question: how does tenure affect the amount of expenditures 
                    a candidate makes throughout his or her Congressional campaign?  Given our own individual 
                    interest in economics and politics, attempting to understand how money affects elections excites 
                    our group and compels us to answer the aforementioned question.  Variables like in which state the candidate runs,
                    or for which district the candidate is up for election, or whether the candidate is a member of a certain political 
                    party are the ones that we immediately thought of when considering what has a strong effect on campaign expenditures;
                    however, through analysis of the data set (VOTE2.DES) from Wooldridge Datasets, we will be able to find a precise and accurate answer.
                    We have wondered the following question: is such exorbitant spending a factor of circumstance—like geography or incumbency?  
                    Or is there a further underlying factor—like personality—that promotes a candidate’s campaign expenditures?  
                    Our intent is to specifically analyze tenure.  We aim to see if tenure promotes a candidate to spend a large or small amount.
